Smart Goals

1. Finish website
2. Put finishing touches on FS-3
3. start on HTML section
4. Don't eat at Brider
5. Attempt meetup write up (it may have been too long)

So I was able to get a good start on my website, as I do present today.  

I also finished FS-3 and submitted it.  Asking for help was the key.  I was able to get my GitHub workflow worked out.

I started on the HTML section, but did not start the assessment.

I was doing so well at not eating at Brider, but then I needed a snack.

I did not attempt the meetup writeup.




In reflection, I need to do a better job of asking for help.  Asking for help was what allowed me to finish FS-3.  I also need to set realisitic goals for what I can accomplish in one day.
