Goals

1. Finish Fs-3
2. finish reading rx
3. finish website
4. Start on HTML portion.

I was unable to complete all of my goals.  I finished the reading comprehension portion, but FS-3 was frustrating to me as I had to keep resubmitting it.  I also spend a considerable amount of time trying to clone and push a git.  My takeaway from this was that I should ask for help sooner, because I didn't ask for help at all.  I thought I was using github correctly, but I was not.  I kept on getting errors.
