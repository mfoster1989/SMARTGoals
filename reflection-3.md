Goals for Wednesday October 25th.

1.  Finish website
2.  Beat at least 4 levels in Flex Froggy
3.  Clone HTML exersizes.

I was able to finish my website.  I was not able to play Flex froggy, or clone the HTML exersizes to my computer.

While I did accomplish the goal of finishing my website, I learned that working on my personal website was not the best use of my time as we were not being graded on it.  I should have spent more time learning Flexbox.

Moving forward, I should talk over my goals with others to see if my goals are worthwhile.
